CHANGES IN VERSION 1.52.0
---------------------------

Significant user-visible changes

     +Changed plotting for makeImages to use ggplot2 rather than lattice

     +Added a new function, vennInLine, intended to allow for placement of
     Venn diagrams in Rmarkdown-derived HTML documents, particularly those
     that use the BiocStyle package for formatting. The Venn diagrams
     contain clickable links that will open HTML tables containing results
     for the genes that are found within that cell of the diagram.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.50.0
----------------------------

Significant user-visible changes

     +Converted runRomer and outputRomer to S4, in the process re-factoring
     they now accept either an ExpressionSet and MArrayLM object (for
     Affymetrix microarray analyses), a DGEList and DGEGLM object (for
     RNA-Seq analysis using edgeR) or an EList and MArrayLM object (for
     either Agilent one-color microarray analysis or limma-voom RNA-Seq
     analysis).


CHANGES IN VERSION  1.43.1
--------------------------

Significant user-visible changes

     +Added new functionality to automatically annotate ExpressionSets,
     using either ChipDb (e.g., hugene10sttranscriptcluster.db) packages,
     pdInfo (e.g., pd.hugene.1.0.v1) packages, or user-supplied
     data.frames.
