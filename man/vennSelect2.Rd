\arguments{
\item{fit}{An \code{\link[limma:marraylm]{MArrayLM}} object, from a call to
\code{\link[limma:ebayes]{eBayes}}.}

\item{contrast}{A contrasts matrix, produced either by hand, or by a call to
\code{\link[limma]{makeContrasts}}}

\item{design}{A design matrix.}

\item{groups}{This argument is used when creating a legend for the resulting
HTML pages. If NULL, the groups will be generated using the column names of
the design matrix.}

\item{cols}{A numeric vector indicating which columns of the fit, contrast
and design matrix to use. If \code{NULL}, all columns will be used.}

\item{p.value}{A p-value to filter the results by.}

\item{lfc}{A log fold change to filter the results by.}

\item{method}{One of "same", "both", "up", "down", "sameup", or "samedown".
See details for more information.}

\item{adj.meth}{Method to use for adjusting p-values. Default is 'BH', which
corresponds to 'fdr'. Ideally one would set this value to be the same as was
used for \code{\link[limma]{decideTests}}.}

\item{titleadd}{Additional text to add to the title of the HTML tables.
Default is NULL, in which case the title of the table will be the same as
the filename.}

\item{fileadd}{Additional text to add to the name of the HTML and CSV
tables. Default is NULL.}

\item{baseUrl}{A character string giving the location of the page in terms
of HTML locations. Defaults to "."}

\item{reportDirectory}{A character string giving the location that the
results will be written. Defaults to "./venns"}

\item{affy}{Boolean; are these Affymetrix arrays, and do you want hyperlinks
for each probeset to the Affy website to be generated for the resulting HTML tables?}

\item{probecol}{If the "affy" argument is \code{TRUE}, what is the column header
for the Affymetrix probeset IDs? Defaults to "PROBEID", which is the default if
the data are annotated using a Bioconductor annotation package.}

\item{\dots}{Used to pass arguments to lower level functions.}
}
\value{
A list with two items. First, a list of \code{HTMLReport} objects
from the ReportingTools package, which can be used to create an index page
with links to the HTML pages created by this function. See the help page for
HTMLReport in ReportingTools as well as the vignettes for more information.
The second item is a \code{vennCounts} object from limma, which can be used
to create a Venn diagram, e.g., in a report if this function is called
within a Sweave or knitR pipeline.
}
\description{
This function is designed to output text and/or HTML tables based on the
results of a call to \code{\link[limma]{decideTests}}, using the
ReportingTools package.
}
\details{
The purpose of this function is to output HTML and text tables with lists of
genes that fulfill the criteria of a call to
\code{\link[limma]{decideTests}} as well as the direction of differential
expression.

Some important things to note: First, the names of the HTML and text tables
are extracted from the \code{colnames} of the \code{TestResults} object,
which come from the contrasts matrix, so it is important to use something
descriptive. Second, the method argument is analogous to the \code{include}
argument from \code{\link[limma:venn]{vennCounts}} or
\code{\link[limma:venn]{vennDiagram}}. Choosing "both" will select genes
that are differentially expressed in one or more comparisons, regardless of
direction. Choosing "up" or "down" will select genes that are only
differentially expressed in one direction. Choosing "same" will select genes
that are differentially expressed in the same direction. Choosing "sameup"
or "samedown" will select genes that are differentially expressed in the
same direction as well as 'up' or 'down'.

Note that this is different than sequentially choosing "up" and then "down".
For instance, a gene that is upregulated in one comparison and downregulated
in another comparison will be listed in the intersection of those two
comparisons if "both" is chosen, it will be listed in only one comparison
for both the "up" and "down" methods, and it will be listed in the union
(e.g., not selected) if "same" is chosen.

Unlike \code{vennSelect}, this function automatically creates both HTML and
CSV output files.
