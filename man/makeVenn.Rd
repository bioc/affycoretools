\title{High-level function for making Venn diagrams and outputting the results from
the diagrams in HTML and CSV files.}
\usage{
makeVenn(fit, contrast, design, groups = NULL, collist = NULL,
  p.value = 0.05, lfc = 0, method = "both", adj.meth = "BH",
  titleadd = NULL, fileadd = NULL, baseUrl = ".",
  reportDirectory = "./venns", affy = TRUE, probecol = "PROBEID", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An \code{\link[limma:marraylm]{MArrayLM}} object, from a call to
\code{\link[limma:ebayes]{eBayes}}.}

\item{contrast}{A contrasts matrix, produced either by hand, or by a call to
\code{\link[limma]{makeContrasts}}}

\item{design}{A design matrix.}

\item{groups}{This argument is used when creating a legend for the resulting
HTML pages. If NULL, the groups will be generated using the column names of
the design matrix. In general it is best to leave this NULL.}

\item{collist}{A list containing numeric vectors indicating which columns of
the fit, contrast and design matrix to use. If \code{NULL}, all columns will
be used.}

\item{p.value}{A p-value to filter the results by.}

\item{lfc}{A log fold change to filter the results by.}

\item{method}{One of "same", "both", "up", "down", "sameup", or "samedown".
See details for more information.}

\item{adj.meth}{Method to use for adjusting p-values. Default is 'BH', which
corresponds to 'fdr'. Ideally one would set this value to be the same as was
used for \code{\link[limma]{decideTests}}.}

\item{titleadd}{Additional text to add to the title of the HTML tables.
Default is NULL, in which case the title of the table will be the same as
the filename.}

\item{fileadd}{Additional text to add to the name of the HTML and CSV
tables. Default is NULL.}

\item{baseUrl}{A character string giving the location of the page in terms
of HTML locations. Defaults to "."}

\item{reportDirectory}{A character string giving the location that the
results will be written. Defaults to "./venns"}

\item{affy}{Boolean. Are these Affymetrix data, and should hyperlinks to the affy website
be generated in the HTML tables?}

\item{probecol}{This argument is used in concert with the preceding argument. If these are Affymetrix data
, then specify the column header in the \code{\link[limma:marraylm]{MArrayLM}} object that contains the Affymetrix IDs. Defaults to
"PROBEID", which is the expected result if the data are annotated using a BioC annotation package.}

\item{...}{Used to pass other arguments to \code{probes2table}, in
particular, to change the argument to \code{anncols} which controls the
columns of hyperlinks to online databases (e.g., Entrez Gene, etc.). See
\code{\link[annaffy]{aaf.handler}} for more information.}
}
\value{
A list containing the output from calling \code{vennSelect2} on the
columns specified by the collist argument. This is intended as input to
\code{vennPage}, which will use those data to create the HTML page with Venn
diagrams with clickable links.
}
\description{
This function is designed to output CSV and HTML tables based on an analysis
using the limma package, with output generated using the ReportingTools
package.
}
\details{
The purpose of this function is to output HTML and text tables with lists of
genes that fulfill the criteria of a call to
\code{\link[limma]{decideTests}} as well as the direction of differential
expression. This is a high-level function that calls \code{vennSelect2}
internally, and is intended to be used with \code{vennPage} to create a set
of Venn diagrams (on an HTML page) that have clickable links in each cell of
the diagram. The links will then pass the end user to individual HTML pages
that contain the genes that are represented by the counts in a given cell of
the Venn diagram.

In general, the only thing that is needed to create a set of Venn diagrams
is a list of numeric vectors that indicate the columns of the contrast
matrix that are to be used for a given diagram. See the example below for a
better explanation.

Some important things to note: First, the names of the HTML and text tables
are extracted from the \code{colnames} of the \code{TestResults} object,
which come from the contrasts matrix, so it is important to use something
descriptive. Second, the method argument is analogous to the \code{include}
argument from \code{\link[limma:venn]{vennCounts}} or
\code{\link[limma:venn]{vennDiagram}}. Choosing "both" will select genes
that are differentially expressed in one or more comparisons, regardless of
direction. Choosing "up" or "down" will select genes that are only
differentially expressed in one direction. Choosing "same" will select genes
that are differentially expressed in the same direction. Choosing "sameup"
or "samedown" will select genes that are differentially expressed in the
same direction as well as 'up' or 'down'.

Note that this is different than sequentially choosing "up" and then "down".
For instance, a gene that is upregulated in one comparison and downregulated
in another comparison will be listed in the intersection of those two
comparisons if "both" is chosen, it will be listed in only one comparison
for both the "up" and "down" methods, and it will be listed in the union
(e.g., not selected) if "same" is chosen.

Unlike \code{vennSelect}, this function automatically creates both HTML and
CSV output files.

Also please note that this function relys on annotation information contained in
the "genes" slot of the "fit" object. If there are no annotation data, then
just statistics will be output in the resulting HTML tables.
