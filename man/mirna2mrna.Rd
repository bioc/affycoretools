\title{A function to map miRNA to mRNA.}
\usage{
  mirna2mrna(miRNAids, miRNAannot, mRNAids, orgPkg,
    chipPkg, sanger = TRUE, miRNAcol = NULL,
    mRNAcol = NULL, transType = "ensembl")
}
\arguments{
  \item{miRNAids}{A character vector of miRNA IDs.
  Currently only supports Affymetrix platform.}

  \item{miRNAannot}{Character. The filename (including path
  if not in working directory) for the file containing
  miRNA to mRNA mappings.}

  \item{mRNAids}{A character vector of mRNA IDs. Currently
  only supports Affymetrix platform.}

  \item{orgPkg}{Character. The Bioconductor organism
  package (e.g., org.Hs.eg.db) to be used for mapping.}

  \item{chipPkg}{Character. The Bioconductor chip-specific
  package (e.g., hgu133plus2.db) to be used for mapping.}

  \item{sanger}{Boolean. Is the miRNAannot file a Sanger
  miRBase targets file? These can be downloaded from
  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm/cgi-bin/targets/v5/download.pl}

  \item{miRNAcol}{Numeric. If using a Sanger miRBase
  targets file, leave \code{NULL}. Otherwise, use this to
  indicate which column of the miRNAannot file contains
  miRNA IDs.}

  \item{mRNAcol}{Numeric. If using Sanger miRBase targets
  file, leave \code{NULL}. Otherwise, use this to indicate
  which column of the miRNAannot file contains mRNA IDs.}

  \item{transType}{Character. Designates the type of
  transcript ID for mRNA supplied by the miRNAannot file.
  If using the Sanger miRBase files, this is ensembl. Other
  choices include refseq and accnum.}
}
\value{
  A list with names that correspond to each significant
  miRNA, and the mRNA probeset IDs that are targeted by
  that miRNA.
}
\description{
  This function is intended use when there are miRNA and
  mRNA data for the same subjects, and the goal is to
  detect mRNAs that appear to be targeted by the miRNA.
}
\details{
  This function is intended to take a vector of miRNA IDs
  that are significantly differentially expressed in a
  given experiment and then map those IDs to putative mRNA
  transcripts that the miRNAs are supposed to target. The
  mRNA transcript IDs are then mapped to chip-specific
  probeset IDs, which are then subsetted to only include
  those probesets that were also significantly
  differentially expressed.

  The output from this function is intended as input for
  \code{\link{makeHmap}}.
