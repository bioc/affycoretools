\title{Filter a topTable object}
\usage{
tableFilt(fit, coef = 1, number = 30, fldfilt = NULL, pfilt = NULL,
  adjust = "fdr")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An \code{MArrayLM} object, resulting from a call to \code{eBayes}}

\item{coef}{The contrast to be extracted into the topTable. See ?topTable
for more information.}

\item{number}{The number of genes to output. Only used if both foldfilt and
pfilt are NULL.}

\item{fldfilt}{The absolute value of fold difference to filter on. This
assumes the data are log transformed.}

\item{pfilt}{The p-value to filter on.}

\item{adjust}{The multiplicity adjustment to use. Options are
'"bonferroni"', '"holm"', '"hochberg"', '"hommel"', '"fdr"' and '"none"'. If
'"none"' then the p-values are not adjusted. A 'NULL' value will result in
the default adjustment method, which is '"fdr"'.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame} containing the selected genes.
}
\description{
This function is designed to filter genes from a \code{topTable} object
based on p-value and/or fold change. This is an internal function and is not
intended to be called by thte end user.
