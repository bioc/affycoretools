\title{High-level function for making Venn diagrams with clickable links to HTML
pages with the underlying genes.}
\usage{
vennPage(vennlst, pagename, pagetitle, cex.venn = 1, shift.title = FALSE,
  baseUrl = ".", reportDirectory = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{vennlst}{The output from \code{makeVenn}.}

\item{pagename}{Character. The file name for the resulting HTML page.
Something like 'venns' is reasonable. Note that the .html will automatically
be appended.}

\item{pagetitle}{Character. The heading for the HTML page.}

\item{cex.venn}{Numeric. Adjusts the size of the font in the Venn diagram.
Usually the default is OK.}

\item{shift.title}{Boolean. Should the right contrast name of the Venn
diagram be shifted down? Useful for long contrast names. If a two-way Venn
diagram, this will shift the right name down so they don't overlap. If a
three-way Venn diagram, this will shift the top right name down.}

\item{baseUrl}{Character. The base URL for the resulting HTML page. The
default of "." is usually optimal.}

\item{reportDirectory}{If \code{NULL}, the reportDirectory will be extracted
from the vennlst. This is usually what one should do.}

\item{...}{To allow passing other arguments to lower level functions.
Currently not used.}
}
\value{
An HTMLReport object. If used as input to the ReportingTools
\code{publish} function, this will create a link on an index page to the
Venn diagram HTML page. See e.g., the microarray analysis vignette for
ReportingTools for more information.
}
\description{
This function is designed to be used in conjunction with the \code{makeVenn}
function, to first create a set of HTML pages containing the genes that are
represented by the cells of a Venn diagram, and then create an HTML page
with the same Venn diagrams, with clickable links that will point the end
user to the HTML pages.
}
\details{
This function is intended to be used as part of a pipeline, by first calling
\code{makeVenn} and then using the output from that function as input to
this function to create the HTML page with clickable links.
}
\examples{

  \dontrun{
    mat <- matrix(rnorm(1e6), ncol = 20)
    design <- model.matrix(~factor(1:4, each=5))
    colnames(design) <- LETTERS[1:4]
    contrast <- matrix(c(1,-1,0,0,1,0,-1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,1,-1,0,0,1,0,-1),
    ncol = 5)
    colnames(contrast) <- paste(LETTERS[c(1,1,1,2,2)],
    LETTERS[c(2,3,4,3,4)], sep = " vs ")
    fit <- lmFit(mat, design)
    fit2 <- contrasts.fit(fit, contrast)
    fit2 <- eBayes(fit2)
    ## two Venn diagrams - a 3-way Venn with the first three contrasts
    ## and a 2-way Venn with the last two contrasts
    collist <- list(1:3,4:5)
    venn <- makeVenn(fit2, contrast, design, eset, collist = collist)
    vennreport <- vennPage(venn, "index.html", "Venn diagrams")
    indexPage <- HTMLReport("index", "My results", reportDirectory =
    ".", baseUrl = ".")
    publish(vennreport)
    finish(indexPage)
    }
