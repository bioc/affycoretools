\title{A function to run the romer function on a set of contrasts.}
\usage{
runRomer(setloc, annot = NULL, eset, design = NULL, contrast = NULL, fit,
  wts = NULL, save = TRUE, baseline.hmap = TRUE, affy = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{setloc}{A character vector giving the path for gene set RData files
(see description for more information).}

\item{annot}{Character. The name of the array annotation package.}

\item{eset}{An \code{\link{ExpressionSet}} containing normalized expression
data.}

\item{design}{A design matrix describing the model fit to the data.}

\item{contrast}{A contrast matrix describing the contrasts that were
computed from the data. This contrast should have colnames, which will be
used to create parts of the resulting directory structure.}

\item{fit}{An \code{MArrayLM} object, containing the fitted model data.}

\item{wts}{Optional weights vector - if array weights were used to fit the
model, they should be supplied here as well.}

\item{save}{Boolean. If true, after running the \code{\link{romer}} step,
the results will be saved in a file 'romer.Rdata', which can be used as
input for \code{outputRomer} to create HTML tables. Since
\code{\link{romer}} can take a long time to run, it is advantageous to keep
the default.}

\item{baseline.hmap}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, then the resulting heatmaps
will be centered by subtracting the mean of the baseline sample. As an
example, in a contrast of treatment A - treatment B, the mean of the
treatment B samples will be subtracted. The heatmap colors then represent
the fold change between the A and B samples.}

\item{affy}{Boolean; are these Affymetrix arrays? If \code{TRUE}, the output tables
will contain links to the netaffx site.}

\item{\dots}{Used to pass arguments to lower-level functions. See
\code{outputRomer} \code{geneSetPage}, \code{dataAndHeatmapPage} and
\code{gsHeatmap} for available arguments.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned. This function is called only for the
side-effects of creating output HTML files in the working and
sub-directories.
}
\description{
This function automates both running \code{\link{romer}} on a set of
contrasts as well as the creation of output HTML tables that can be used to
explore the results.  The basic idea here is that one might have used limma
to fit a model and compute some contrasts, and then want to do a GSEA using
\code{\link{romer}}.
}
\details{
The \code{\link{romer}} expects as input a list or lists of gene symbols
that represent individual gene sets. One example is the various gene sets
from the Broad Institute that are available at
http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/, which are distributed as RData
files. The default assumption for this function is that the end user will
have downloaded these files, and the setloc argument simply tells
\code{runRomer} where to find them.

Alternatively, user-based gene sets could be created (these should consist
of lists of character vectors of gene symbols - see one of the Broad gene
sets for an example).

This function will run \code{\link{romer}} using all the gene sets in the
referenced directory, on all the contrasts supplied, and then output the
results in a (default) 'genesets' subdirectory. There will be an HTML file
in the working directory with a (default) filename of 'indexRomer.html' that
will point to individual HTML files in the genesets subdirectory, which will
point to individual files in subdirectories within the genesets subdirectory
(named after the colnames of the contrast matrix).
